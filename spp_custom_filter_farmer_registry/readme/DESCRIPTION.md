# OpenSPP Custom Filter Farmer Registry

## Overview

The **OpenSPP Custom Filter Farmer Registry"** module customizes the user interface (UI) for filtering in specific OpenSPP modules, enhancing usability and simplifying data management. It builds upon the [spp_custom_filter UI](spp_custom_filter_ui) module, which provides the underlying functionality for controlling which fields are displayed in filter dropdown menus.

This module is designed to tailor the filtering interface for the Res Partner model, which is widely utilized within OpenSPP to represent registrants. By selectively exposing relevant fields for filtering, the module aims to streamline user workflows and enhance the overall user experience within the OpenSPP system.
